/*Selection sort in C to sort numbers of an array in ascending order. With a little modification, it arranges numbers in descending order.

Selection sort algorithm (for ascending order)
Find the minimum element in the array and swap it with the element in the 1st position.
Find the minimum element again in the remaining array[2, n] and swap it with the element at 2nd position, now we have two elements at their correct positions.
We have to do this n-1 times to sort the array.

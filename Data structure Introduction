Data structure:-
              1.data structure is systimatic way to orgnize the he data ,so that it can be used efficienly.
              ex-array=insted of creating number of variables of same type ,why not creating the array to store the data type.
              or
              2.data structure in way t store data element into the memory(into the main memory)in an organized manner so that the operations like addition,deletation,traversal 
              ,searching,sorting etc.

 Advantages of data structure:-Efficiency:-
            1.Efficiency of a program depends upon the choice of data structures. For example: suppose, we have some data and we need to perform the search for a perticular
            record. In that case, if we organize our data in an array, we will have to search sequentially element by element. hence, using array may not be very efficient here. There are better data structures which can make the search process efficient like ordered array, binary search tree or hash tables.

            2.Reusability: Data structures are reusable, i.e. once we have implemented a particular data structure, we can use it at any other place.
            Implementation of data structures can be compiled into libraries which can be used by different clients.

            3.Abstraction: Data structure is specified by the ADT which provides a level of abstraction. The client program uses the data structure through interface only,
            without getting into the implementation details.

Data Structure Classification
           For coledge oral:-
            1.There is a need of data  structure to archive 3 things in programmeing
                    1.Efficiency
                    2.Abstraction
                    3.Reusabiliity
Need of Data Structures:-
             As applications are getting complexed and amount of data is increasing day by day, there may arrise the following problems:

             1.Processor speed: To handle very large amout of data, high speed processing is required, but as the data is growing day by day to the billions of files per entity, 
             processor may fail to deal with that much amount of data.

             2.Data Search: Consider an inventory size of 106 items in a store, If our application needs to search for a particular item, it needs to traverse 106 items every time,
             results in slowing down the search process.

             3.Multiple requests: If thousands of users are searching the data simultaneously on a web server, then there are the chances that a very large server can be failed 
             during that process

in order to solve the above problems, data structures are used. Data is organized to form a data structure in such a way that all items are not required to be searched and 
required data can be searched instantly.

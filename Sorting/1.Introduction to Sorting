**What is the sorting?**

The arrangement of data in a preferred order is called sorting in the data structure. By sorting data, it is easier to search through it quickly and easily.
The simplest example of sorting is a dictionary. Before the era of the Internet, when you wanted to look up a word in a dictionary, you would do so in alphabetical order.
This made it easy.

**There are two different categories in sorting:**

Internal sorting: 
       If the input data is such that it can be adjusted in the main memory at once, it is called internal sorting.

External sorting:
      If the input data is such that it cannot be adjusted in the memory entirely at once, it needs to be stored in a hard disk, floppy disk, or any other storage device.
      This is called external sorting.

**Types of Sorting in Data Structure:-**

Here are a few of the most common types of sorting algorithms.

**1. Merge Sort**
This algorithm works on splitting an array into two halves of comparable sizes. Each half is then sorted and merged back together by using the merge () function.

Hereâ€™s how the algorithm works:

MergeSort(arr[], l,  r)

1.If r > l

1.Divide the array into two equal halves by locating the middle point:  
             middle m = (l+r)/2

2.Use the mergeSort function to call for the first half:   
             Call mergeSort(arr, l, m)

3.Call mergeSort for the second half:
             Call mergeSort(arr, m+1, r)

4.Use the merge () function to merge the two halves sorted in step 2 and 3:
             Call merge(arr, l, m, r)

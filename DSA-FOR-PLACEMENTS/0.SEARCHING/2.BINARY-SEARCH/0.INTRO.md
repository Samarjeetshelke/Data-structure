Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, narrow the interval to the lower half. Otherwise, narrow it to the upper half. Repeatedly check until the value is found or the interval is empty.

### How Binary Search Works
1. **Initialization**: Set two pointers, `left` at the start of the array and `right` at the end of the array.
2. **Middle Element**: Calculate the middle index.
   \[
   \text{mid} = \left + \left(\frac{\text{right} - \text{left}}{2}\right)
   \]
3. **Comparison**:
   - If the middle element is the target, the search is complete.
   - If the target is less than the middle element, repeat the search in the lower half of the array.
   - If the target is greater than the middle element, repeat the search in the upper half of the array.
4. **Repeat** the process until the pointers converge or the element is found.

### Time Complexity
- **Worst-case**: \(O(\log n)\)
- **Best-case**: \(O(1)\) (when the middle element is the target)
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\) for the iterative approach and \(O(\log n)\) for the recursive approach due to the recursion stack.

### Implementation in C++
Here are the iterative and recursive implementations of binary search in C++:

#### Iterative Implementation
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int binarySearch(int arr[], int left, int right, int x) {
    while (left <= right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

        // Check if x is present at mid
        if (arr[mid] == x)
            return mid;

        // If x greater, ignore left half
        if (arr[mid] < x)
            left = mid + 1;
        else // If x is smaller, ignore right half
            right = mid - 1;
    }

    // If we reach here, the element was not present
    return -1;
}

int main() {
    int arr[] = {2, 3, 4, 10, 40};
    int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);
    int x = 10;
    int result = binarySearch(arr, 0, n - 1, x);
    (result == -1) ? cout << "Element is not present in array"
                   : cout << "Element is present at index " << result;
    return 0;
}
```

#### Recursive Implementation
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int binarySearch(int arr[], int left, int right, int x) {
    if (right >= left) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

        // If the element is present at the middle
        if (arr[mid] == x)
            return mid;

        // If the element is smaller than mid, then it can only be present in the left subarray
        if (arr[mid] > x)
            return binarySearch(arr, left, mid - 1, x);

        // Otherwise, the element can only be present in the right subarray
        return binarySearch(arr, mid + 1, right, x);
    }

    // If the element is not present in the array
    return -1;
}

int main() {
    int arr[] = {2, 3, 4, 10, 40};
    int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);
    int x = 10;
    int result = binarySearch(arr, 0, n - 1, x);
    (result == -1) ? cout << "Element is not present in array"
                   : cout << "Element is present at index " << result;
    return 0;
}
```

### Key Points
- **Sorted Data**: Binary search works only on sorted arrays or lists.
- **Efficiency**: Much more efficient than linear search for large datasets.
- **Divide and Conquer**: It follows the divide-and-conquer approach, reducing the problem size by half each time.


### Time Complexity of Binary Search

Binary search is an efficient algorithm with a time complexity that is logarithmic, specifically \(O(\log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array. Let's break down why this is the case.



#### Analyzing Time Complexity
1. **Initial Problem Size**: The array has \(n\) elements.
2. **First Step**: The array is divided into two halves, each of size \(n/2\).
3. **Second Step**: One of these halves is again divided into two, resulting in subarrays of size \(n/4\).
4. **Subsequent Steps**: Each step continues to halve the size of the subarray:
   - Step 3: Subarray size \(n/4\)
   - Step 4: Subarray size \(n/8\)
   - ...
   - Step \(k\): Subarray size \(n/2^k\)

The process continues until the size of the subarray is 1. To find the number of steps \(k\) required to reduce the array size to 1:
\[
\frac{n}{2^k} = 1 \implies n = 2^k \implies k = \log_2 n
\]

Thus, the time complexity of binary search is \(O(\log n)\).

#### Best, Worst, and Average Cases
- **Best Case**: \(O(1)\) when the middle element is the target element.
- **Worst Case**: \(O(\log n)\) when the element is at the very end of the array or not present at all.
- **Average Case**: \(O(\log n)\) since each iteration consistently reduces the search space by half.

#### Space Complexity
- **Iterative Binary Search**: Uses \(O(1)\) space as it only requires a few variables for pointers and indices.
- **Recursive Binary Search**: Uses \(O(\log n)\) space due to the recursion stack.

### Example Walkthrough
Consider an array with 16 elements:
\[ [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16] \]
- **Step 1**: Middle element is 8.
- **Step 2**: If searching for 12, the search continues in the right half.
\[ [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16] \]
- **Step 3**: Middle element is 12, target found.

This took 3 steps (\(\log_2 16 = 4\)), demonstrating the logarithmic nature.

### Conclusion
Binary search's logarithmic time complexity \(O(\log n)\) makes it highly efficient for large, sorted datasets. It drastically reduces the number of comparisons needed to find an element compared to linear search, which has a time complexity of \(O(n)\). This efficiency is why binary search is a fundamental algorithm in computer science.

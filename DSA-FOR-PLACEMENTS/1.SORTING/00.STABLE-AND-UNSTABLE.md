Sorting algorithms can be divided into stable and unstable categories based on whether or not they preserve the relative order of equal elements.

### Stable Sorting Algorithms

A sorting algorithm is considered stable if it maintains the relative order of records with equal keys (i.e., values).

1. **Bubble Sort:**
   - Description: Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
   - Stability: Stable
   - Time Complexity: \(O(n^2)\)

2. **Insertion Sort:**
   - Description: Builds the final sorted array one item at a time, with the input elements being inserted one by one in their correct position.
   - Stability: Stable
   - Time Complexity: \(O(n^2)\)

3. **Merge Sort:**
   - Description: Divides the array into halves, sorts them, and then merges them back together.
   - Stability: Stable
   - Time Complexity: \(O(n \log n)\)

4. **Counting Sort:**
   - Description: Counts the number of occurrences of each unique element and uses this information to place elements in the correct position.
   - Stability: Stable
   - Time Complexity: \(O(n + k)\), where \(k\) is the range of the input

5. **Radix Sort:**
   - Description: Sorts numbers digit by digit, starting from the least significant digit to the most significant digit using a stable sort (like Counting Sort) at each step.
   - Stability: Stable
   - Time Complexity: \(O(nk)\), where \(k\) is the number of digits

6. **Tim Sort:**
   - Description: Hybrid sorting algorithm derived from merge sort and insertion sort.
   - Stability: Stable
   - Time Complexity: \(O(n \log n)\)

### Unstable Sorting Algorithms

A sorting algorithm is considered unstable if it does not maintain the relative order of records with equal keys.

1. **Selection Sort:**
   - Description: Repeatedly selects the minimum element from the unsorted portion and places it at the beginning.
   - Stability: Unstable
   - Time Complexity: \(O(n^2)\)

2. **Quick Sort:**
   - Description: Divides the array into smaller sub-arrays (partitions) based on a pivot element and recursively sorts the sub-arrays.
   - Stability: Unstable (but can be made stable with modifications)
   - Time Complexity: \(O(n \log n)\) on average, \(O(n^2)\) in the worst case

3. **Heap Sort:**
   - Description: Builds a heap from the input data and then repeatedly extracts the maximum element from the heap and reconstructs the heap.
   - Stability: Unstable
   - Time Complexity: \(O(n \log n)\)

4. **Shell Sort:**
   - Description: Generalization of insertion sort that allows the exchange of items that are far apart.
   - Stability: Unstable
   - Time Complexity: Depends on the gap sequence, typically \(O(n \log^2 n)\)

| Insertion Sort  | Stable           | \(O(n^2)\)                |
| Merge Sort      | Stable           | \(O(n \log n)\)           |
| Counting Sort   | Stable           | \(O(n + k)\)              |
| Radix Sort      | Stable           | \(O(nk)\)                 |
| Tim Sort        | Stable           | \(O(n \log n)\)           |
| Selection Sort  | Unstable         | \(O(n^2)\)                |
| Quick Sort      | Unstable         | \(O(n \log n)\)           |
| Heap Sort       | Unstable         | \(O(n \log n)\)           |
| Shell Sort      | Unstable         | \(O(n \log^2 n)\)         |

Choosing between stable and unstable sorting algorithms depends on the specific requirements of your application. If the relative order of equal elements matters, a stable sorting algorithm is necessary. If not, you can choose based on other factors like time complexity and space complexity.

Insertion sort is another simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much like sorting playing cards in your hands. The algorithm divides the list into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.

### Steps:
1. Start with the second element (the first element is considered sorted).
2. Compare this element with the elements in the sorted part (left side) and insert it into the correct position.
3. Repeat the process for all elements in the array.

### Example in C++

Here is an implementation of insertion sort in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

void insertionSort(vector<int>& arr) {
    int n = arr.size();
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        int key = arr[i];
        int j = i - 1;
        
        // Move elements of arr[0..i-1], that are greater than key, to one position ahead of their current position
        while (j >= 0 && arr[j] > key) {
            arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
            j = j - 1;
        }
        arr[j + 1] = key;
    }
}

int main() {
    vector<int> arr = {12, 11, 13, 5, 6};
    cout << "Original array: ";
    for (int i : arr) {
        cout << i << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;

    insertionSort(arr);

    cout << "Sorted array: ";
    for (int i : arr) {
        cout << i << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **`insertionSort` Function**:
   - The function takes a reference to a vector of integers.
   - It iterates from the second element to the last element.
   - For each element, it stores the value of the element in `key` and starts a while loop to find the correct position for `key` in the sorted part of the array.
   - Elements greater than `key` are shifted one position to the right.
   - Once the correct position is found, `key` is inserted.

2. **`main` Function**:
   - A sample array is defined.
   - The original array is printed.
   - The `insertionSort` function is called to sort the array.
   - The sorted array is printed.

The complexity of the insertion sort algorithm can be analyzed in terms of time and space complexity.

### Time Complexity:

**Best Case:** \( O(n) \)
- This occurs when the array is already sorted. The inner loop only compares the current element with the previous element, resulting in a linear time complexity.

**Worst Case:** \( O(n^2) \)
- This occurs when the array is sorted in reverse order. In this case, each insertion requires shifting all previously sorted elements, leading to a quadratic time complexity.

**Average Case:** \( O(n^2) \)
- On average, the elements need to be compared and shifted about halfway through the sorted portion of the array, resulting in a quadratic time complexity.

### Space Complexity:

**Space Complexity:** \( O(1) \)
- Insertion sort is an in-place sorting algorithm, meaning it requires a constant amount of additional memory space.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Best Case:** When the array is already sorted, the outer loop runs \( n-1 \) times, and the inner loop runs \( 1 \) time for each outer loop iteration. Thus, the best-case time complexity is \( O(n) \).

- **Worst Case:** When the array is sorted in reverse order, for each element, the inner loop runs \( k \) times where \( k \) is the current index of the outer loop. Therefore, the total number of comparisons and shifts is:
  \[
  1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + (n-1) = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \approx O(n^2)
  \]

- **Average Case:** On average, each element in the array is compared to about half of the sorted elements before it finds its correct position. Therefore, the average case also results in \( O(n^2) \) time complexity.

### Practical Considerations:

- Insertion sort is efficient for small arrays or lists.
- It is a stable sorting algorithm, meaning it preserves the relative order of equal elements.
- It is adaptive, meaning it is efficient for data sets that are already substantially sorted.

Here's a summary of the complexities:

| Complexity     | Best Case | Average Case | Worst Case |
|----------------|-----------|--------------|------------|
| Time           | \( O(n) \)    | \( O(n^2) \)      | \( O(n^2) \)    |
| Space          | \( O(1) \)    | \( O(1) \)      | \( O(1) \)    |

Insertion sort is often used as a subroutine in more complex sorting algorithms, such as Timsort or hybrid algorithms, where it is applied to small portions of the data that need to be sorted.

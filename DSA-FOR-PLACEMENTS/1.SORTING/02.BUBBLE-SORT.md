### Bubble Sort Explanation

Bubble Sort is a simple and intuitive sorting algorithm. Its name comes from the way larger elements "bubble" to the top of the array. The basic idea is to repeatedly traverse the list, compare adjacent elements, and swap them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the list is sorted.

### How Bubble Sort Works

1. **Compare Adjacent Elements:**
   - Starting from the beginning of the array, compare each pair of adjacent elements.
   - If the first element is greater than the second, swap them.
   - Continue this process for each pair of adjacent elements from the start to the end of the array.

2. **Pass Through the Array:**
   - After the first pass, the largest element will have "bubbled" up to the last position of the array.
   - Repeat the process for the remaining unsorted part of the array (excluding the last sorted element).

3. **Repeat Until Sorted:**
   - Continue making passes through the array, each time moving the next largest element to its correct position.
   - The process is repeated until no swaps are needed, indicating that the array is sorted.

### Characteristics of Bubble Sort

- **Time Complexity:**
  - Worst-case: \(O(n^2)\)
  - Average-case: \(O(n^2)\)
  - Best-case: \(O(n)\) (when the array is already sorted)
  
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\) (in-place sorting)

- **Stability:** Yes (equal elements retain their relative order)

- **Adaptive:** No (does not take advantage of existing order in the array)

### Example Walkthrough

Consider sorting the array `[5, 3, 8, 4, 2]`:

1. **First Pass:**
   - Compare 5 and 3 → Swap → `[3, 5, 8, 4, 2]`
   - Compare 5 and 8 → No Swap → `[3, 5, 8, 4, 2]`
   - Compare 8 and 4 → Swap → `[3, 5, 4, 8, 2]`
   - Compare 8 and 2 → Swap → `[3, 5, 4, 2, 8]`

2. **Second Pass:**
   - Compare 3 and 5 → No Swap → `[3, 5, 4, 2, 8]`
   - Compare 5 and 4 → Swap → `[3, 4, 5, 2, 8]`
   - Compare 5 and 2 → Swap → `[3, 4, 2, 5, 8]`
   - 8 is already in the correct position.

3. **Third Pass:**
   - Compare 3 and 4 → No Swap → `[3, 4, 2, 5, 8]`
   - Compare 4 and 2 → Swap → `[3, 2, 4, 5, 8]`
   - 5 and 8 are already in the correct position.

4. **Fourth Pass:**
   - Compare 3 and 2 → Swap → `[2, 3, 4, 5, 8]`
   - 4, 5, and 8 are already in the correct position.

The array is now sorted: `[2, 3, 4, 5, 8]`.

### C++ Implementation

```cpp

// Online C++ compiler to run C++ program online
#include <iostream>
#include<algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    

    int arr[] = {1,2,3,4,5,6};
    int n = sizeof(arr)/sizeof(int);
    int i ;
    int j;
    bool flg = false;
    
    for(i=0;i<(n-1);i++){
        flg = false;
        
        for(j=0;j<(n-i);j++){
            if(arr[j]>arr[j+1]){
                swap(arr[j],arr[j+1]);
                flg = true;
            }
        }
        
        /if(!flg){
            break;
        }
        
    }
    
    cout<<(++i)*(++j);
    
    for(int i : arr){
        cout<<" "<<i;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Python Implementation

```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        swapped = False
        for j in range(0, n - i - 1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:
                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]
                swapped = True
        if not swapped:
            break

def print_array(arr):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        print(arr[i], end=" ")
    print()

# Example usage
arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
print("Unsorted array:")
print_array(arr)

bubble_sort(arr)

print("Sorted array:")
print_array(arr)
```

### Key Points

- Bubble Sort is easy to understand and implement but is inefficient for large datasets due to its quadratic time complexity.
- It can be optimized by stopping early if no swaps are made in a pass, indicating the array is already sorted.

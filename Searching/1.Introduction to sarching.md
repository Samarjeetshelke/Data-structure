**Searching**:-<br>

Searching Algorithms are designed to check for an element or retrieve an element from any data structure where it is stored.<br>
Based on the type of search operation, these algorithms are generally classified into two categories:<br>
                                  1.Sequential Search<br>
                                  2.Interval Search<br>
<br>
---

**1.Sequential Search:** In this, the list or array is traversed sequentially and every element is checked. For example: Linear Search.<br>
**2.Interval Search**: These algorithms are specifically designed for searching in sorted data-structures.<br>
These type of searching algorithms are much more efficient than Linear Search as they repeatedly target the center of the search structure and divide the search space in half.<br>
For Example: Binary Search.<br>
